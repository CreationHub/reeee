Since then ten different versions and sequels has been released between PS2, PS3, PSP and PS4. The latest game being released 2018 under the title: “God of War A Call from the Wilds” featuring Kratos and his son Atreus whose fled to Midgard in hope to live a life away from chaos. But since Kratos is the chaos himself he is not being well treated as an outsider of the realms. With his son not knowing what his father’s sins and past looks like, making the story takes turns not to be expected.
The first God of War game is about the demigod Kratos, and how he goes from being a normal spartan warrior to being enslaved by Ares the God of War with wishes of winning the war against the Barbarians. Kratos therefore gives his life to the God of War in sacrifice to save his own life, which then becomes his burden and curse when he is tricked to plunder a village where his family lived. Kratos then got cursed by an old witch for the sins he had done and covered him in the ashes of his family, which gave him the title: “The Ghost of Sparta”. Kratos then seeks vengeance on the gods of olympus to make up for the burden he has caused and the voices in his head.
